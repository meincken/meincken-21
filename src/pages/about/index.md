title: About Me
---
My name is Nick Meincken, I'm a web developer based in South West London with a
wife and 2 cats. I enjoy travelling to obscure places and taking photos, but the
current pandemic pushed me to reignite an old passion in art and illustration.

Art and Photography have always provided me with pure escapism from my digital
world, although lately this has merged together with the use of digital media.
I still like to shoot film when possible, but not really having the space for a
darkroom or wanting all the chemicals in the house, it made sense to move to
scanning and editing pure images.

Although recently I have been playing around with a number of other media like
watercolours, acrylic paint, as well as pure ink but also experimenting with
different paper materials.
